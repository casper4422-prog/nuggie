ARK: Survival Ascended Master Achievement Systems
1. Prized Bloodline Badge System
This system celebrates the ultimate achievement in breeding: creating creatures with perfectly consistent base stat points across all five core categories, ensuring no genetic weak links.

Core Philosophy

All-or-Nothing System: A single stat below the threshold means no badge is awarded.


Base Stats Only: The system only evaluates the wild stats of a creature at the time it was tamed; mutations and manually added levels are not counted.


Perfect Balance: It is designed to reward breeders who achieve consistency across all important stats, not just Health and Melee.


Universal Application: This system is applicable to every tameable species in the game.

Calculation Method
The badge tier is determined by the lowest value among the five core stats.

What Counts:

Base stat points.

The five core stats: Health, Stamina, Food, Weight, and Melee.

What Doesn't Count:

Oxygen and Movement Speed are not included in the calculation.


Mutations and domestic (post-tame) levels are also excluded.

2. Boss Ready Badge System
This system provides a complete achievement guide for breeding creatures specifically for boss encounters.
